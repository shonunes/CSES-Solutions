## Introduction
The CSES Problem Set is a well-known collection of competitive programming problems that cover various topics such as sorting, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and more. This repository contains my solutions to these problems, which I am actively working on.

## Getting Started
To use these solutions:
1. Clone this repository:
  ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shonunes/CSES-Solutions.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
  ```sh
  cd CSES-Solutions
  ```
3. Compile and run a solution using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
  ```sh
  g++ problem_name.cpp -o problem_name
  ./problem_name
  ```

## Repository Structure
The solutions are organized in a structured manner:
```
📁 CSES-Solutions
├── 📁 Sorting_and_Searching
│   ├── problem1.cpp
│   ├── problem2.cpp
│   └── ...
├── 📁 Dynamic_Programming
│   ├── problem1.cpp
│   ├── problem2.cpp
│   └── ...
├── 📁 ...
└── README.md
```
- Each problem is placed under its corresponding category.
- The problem names match their official CSES titles.

## Contributing
